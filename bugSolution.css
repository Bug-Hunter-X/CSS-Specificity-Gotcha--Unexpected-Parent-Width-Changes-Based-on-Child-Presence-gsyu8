Several solutions exist to resolve the specificity issue:

**1. Explicitly Set Widths:** Instead of relying on implicit behavior, explicitly set the widths of both the container and its items.  Make sure these styles don't conflict.  If the `.item` width is to influence the parent's width (perhaps as a means of layout) use a technique that explicitly calculates the parent's width.   This makes the relationship between child and parent widths explicit and avoids unintended effects.

```css
.container { width: 80%; display: flex; }
.container .item { width: 50%; }
```

**2. Use Flexbox or Grid:** Employing flexbox or grid layouts provides a more robust and predictable way to manage element sizing and positioning. These layout systems allow for explicit control over child element sizes and how they affect parent container dimensions.

```css
.container { display: flex; width: 80%; }
.container .item { width: 50%; }
```

**3. Avoid Overlapping Specificity:** If possible, restructure your CSS to avoid overlapping specificity. This might involve renaming classes or restructuring your HTML to reduce the number of overlapping selectors.
